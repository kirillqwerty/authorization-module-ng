[Component-validator](https://github.com/kirillqwerty/authorization-module-ng/tree/main/src/app/authorization/err-wrapper) represents a component that wraps the input field, and as a result, validation errors will be drawn under it. It takes a control as inputs (formControl, formGroup or formArray), optionally it can take the path where the control will be located (if formgroup/array is passed).

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.2.0.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
